# rstone
My programming rosetta stone.
Sometimes its hard remember which programming language uses which syntax.
For example, "endif" -- does Bourne shell use that?  Or does it use "fi"?
Spoiler: "fi" is shell.  So who does use "endif"?
C pre-processor conditionals.  :-)

Thanks to http://bhami.com/rosetta.html for making a far more useful site
(and coming up with an awesome name).
