# rstone
My programming rosetta stone.
Sometimes its hard remember which programming language uses which syntax.
For example, "endif" -- does Bourne shell use that?  Or does it use "fi"?
(Spoiler: "fi" is shell.)
So who uses "endif"?  C pre-processor conditionals.  :-)

Thanks to http://bhami.com/rosetta.html for making a far more useful site and coming up with the name.
